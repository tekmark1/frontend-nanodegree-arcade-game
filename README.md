===============================

Loading the game is simple: Open the index.html file and you are ready to go.

Playing the game is also very simple. Once the game is loaded, use the arrow keys to move the player. As a user, you have two goals: first, reach the water; second, avoid the enemies.

Once you reach the water, your player will reset to its original position (enemies will not), at which time you are free to play again.

If your player collides with an enemy, your player will reset to its original position and you will start over.
